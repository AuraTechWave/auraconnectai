# AuraConnect Project Status — 2025-09-24

## Executive Snapshot
- **Backend:** Auth, tenant isolation, and several service integrations still rely on development-only scaffolding. Production deployment will fail without a real user store, Redis-backed sessions, and completed POS/Tax integrations.
- **Frontend (Web):** API clients target `/api/v1/...` endpoints that the FastAPI server does not expose. Authentication, RBAC, and WebSocket flows are stubbed, leaving key pages non-functional.
- **Mobile:** Offline/analytics screens use placeholder data and unimplemented sync recovery steps. Auth still depends on mock backend behaviour.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker/Compose assets omit dependency installation, Postgres, Redis, S3, or deployment configuration. Secrets management is unfunded; CI/CD is undefined.
- **Testing/Quality:** Backend suite exists but requires Postgres/Redis fixtures. Web/mobile lack reliable integration coverage. Cross-cutting middleware (tenant isolation, response standardisation) needs contract tests.
- **Time-to-Prod Estimate:** ~10–12 weeks with a dedicated core team (2 backend, 2 frontend, 1 mobile, 1 QA/DevOps) to reach production readiness; longer with fewer resources or integration delays.

## Detailed Observations

### Backend
- `backend/core/auth.py:70` — Authentication still uses hard-coded mock users and explicitly disables itself outside development. Replace with a real user/tenant store before production.
- `backend/core/tenant_context.py:76` — Tenant isolation middleware expects tenant claims from JWTs; without real auth those checks cannot succeed.
- `backend/core/cache_service.py:17` & `backend/core/session_manager.py:76` — Redis connections are mandatory in code paths (cache, sessions, rate limiting). When Redis is absent, the code falls back to unsafe in-memory storage.
- `backend/modules/pos/adapters/toast_adapter.py:108` & `backend/modules/tax/services/tax_integration_service.py:206` — Several integrations still raise `NotImplementedError`, so production flows would crash.
- `backend/app/startup.py:87` — Startup validation warns about missing tables and fails if Redis/DB are not configured, confirming infrastructure gaps.

### Frontend (Web)
- `frontend/src/services/orderService.ts:17` & `frontend/src/services/customerApi.ts:31` — API services call `/api/...` endpoints, but FastAPI registers routes without that prefix. This guarantees 404 responses.
- `frontend/src/components/auth/AuthWrapper.tsx:13` — Route guard assumes authentication is always true; no real RBAC enforcement exists.
- `frontend/src/components/admin/orders/OrderList.tsx:70` — Relies on WebSocket tokens/connection that never initialise because login remains mocked.
- `frontend/src/__tests__/integration/OrderFlow.test.tsx:52` — Tests reference `mockedOrderService` without defining the mock, so the suite fails immediately.

### Mobile
- `mobile/src/screens/analytics/AnalyticsScreen.tsx:65` — Analytics queries return canned data; TODOs mark missing API integration.
- `mobile/src/sync/errors/SyncErrorHandler.ts:103` — Re-authentication, queue cleanup, and conflict resolution remain TODOs.
- `mobile/src/sync/SyncQueue.ts:103` — Queue processes only local WatermelonDB operations; server sync/dead-letter handling unfinished.
- `mobile/src/services/auth.service.ts:12` — Calls backend auth endpoints that still rely on mock behaviour.

### Infrastructure & Ops
- `Dockerfile.backend:1` & `docker-compose.yml:4` — Containers copy source but do not install dependencies or run migrations. Compose lacks Postgres, Redis, or storage services.
- `backend/core/secrets.py:45` — Startup enforces secrets, but no templates or env provisioning exist for JWT, DB, Redis, S3, or payment credentials.
- Deployment manifests (e.g., `deploy/railway.toml`) are placeholders; there is no CI/CD story or automation for migrations and health checks.

### Quality & Testing
- Backend tests (`backend/tests/...`) require proper DB/Redis fixtures; none were executed during this review.
- Web/mobile lack meaningful integration/E2E coverage; major flows (auth, orders) remain untested.
- Response standardisation and tenant isolation introduce heavy cross-cutting behaviour; targeted contract tests are needed prior to release.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Align API Surface:** Decide on canonical path prefixes (`/auth` vs `/api/v1/auth`) and update both FastAPI routers and all client services to match.
2. **Implement Real Auth/RBAC:** Replace mock users with database-backed identity, enable tenant-aware JWT issuance, and validate session/Redis infrastructure.
3. **Provision Infrastructure:** Add Postgres, Redis, and S3-compatible storage to local/CI stacks; install dependencies in Docker images; run the backend test suite to establish a baseline.
4. **Complete Critical Integrations:** Feature-flag or finish POS and tax adapters, ensure payment/webhook flows degrade gracefully.
5. **Stabilise Frontend & Mobile:** Hook UI/API layers to real endpoints, replace placeholder data, and build coverage for key flows (login, orders, analytics).
6. **Harden Deployment:** Create environment templates for secrets, define migration/rollout steps, and add monitoring/logging for production.
