Enhanced responsive breakpoints with:
- Complete breakpoint system from `xs` to `2xl`
- Clear device category mappings (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Large Displays)
- Tailwind media query usage examples
- Pixel ranges for each device category

## Developer Experience Improvements

### ✅ Routing & Access Control Documentation
**New File**: `ROUTING_ACCESS_CONTROL.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Authentication & Authorization flow diagram (Mermaid)
- Route configuration structure with TypeScript interfaces
- Protected route components with examples
- Permission system architecture
- Dynamic navigation generation
- Route guards and middleware patterns
- Route preloading and code splitting strategies

### ✅ Centralized Route Configuration
**File**: `ROUTING_ACCESS_CONTROL.md`

Created `routeConfig.ts` example with:
- Centralized route metadata structure
- Role-based access configuration
- Permission requirements per route
- Nested route support
- Meta information for SEO and preloading

## CI/CD and Deployment

- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) examples
- CloudFront CDN configuration

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**File**: `FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT_CICD.md`

Testing approach covering:
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Component tests with Storybook and Chromatic
- E2E tests with Playwright (with examples)
- Performance testing with Lighthouse budgets
- Security testing integration

### ✅ Monitoring & Observability
**File**: `FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT_CICD.md`

Added monitoring setup with:
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- OpenTelemetry for custom metrics
