# AUR-446: Address SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

## Summary of Changes

This PR addresses critical SQL injection vulnerabilities in the analytics and reporting services by replacing raw string formatting with parameterized queries and implementing comprehensive input sanitization.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Secure Query Builder** (`modules/analytics/services/secure_query_builder.py`)
- Created a centralized query builder that uses parameterized queries
- Replaced all f-string SQL query construction with parameter placeholders
- Added validation for table names, column names, and SQL functions
- Implemented safe methods for dynamic query construction

### 2. **Fixed Vulnerable Services**
- **demand_prediction_service.py**: Replaced vulnerable f-string queries with secure parameterized queries
- **background_jobs.py**: Added validation for materialized view names to prevent injection

### 3. **Input Sanitization** (`modules/analytics/utils/input_sanitizer.py`)
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization utilities
- SQL keyword detection and rejection
- Safe handling of identifiers, numeric values, dates, and enums
- LIKE pattern escaping to prevent wildcard injection
- ORDER BY clause sanitization

### 4. **Linting and Pre-commit Hooks**
- **`.flake8`**: Added SQL injection detection rules (B608, B611)
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: 
  - Added flake8-bandit and flake8-sql for security checks
  - Created custom SQL injection pattern detection hook
  - Enhanced security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### 5. **Test Coverage** (`modules/analytics/tests/test_sql_injection_prevention.py`)
- Comprehensive tests for secure query building
- Input sanitization validation tests
- SQL injection attempt rejection tests

## Security Improvements

### Before (Vulnerable):
```python
# Direct string formatting - SQL INJECTION RISK!
return f"""
    SELECT * FROM orders 
    WHERE menu_item_id = {product_id}
    AND created_at >= '{start_date}'
"""
```

### After (Secure):
```python
# Parameterized query - SAFE
query = """
    SELECT * FROM orders 
    WHERE menu_item_id = :product_id
    AND created_at >= :start_date
"""
params = {"product_id": product_id, "start_date": start_date}
db.execute(text(query), params)
```

## Key Security Features

1. **Parameterized Queries**: All dynamic SQL now uses parameter binding
2. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs before use in queries
3. **Whitelist Approach**: Only allowed tables, columns, and functions are permitted
4. **SQL Keyword Blocking**: Common SQL injection keywords are detected and rejected
5. **Automated Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent introduction of new vulnerabilities

## Testing

All changes have been tested to ensure:
- Queries execute correctly with parameters
- Invalid inputs are properly rejected
- SQL injection attempts are blocked
- Existing functionality remains intact

## Deployment Notes

1. No database schema changes required
2. No breaking API changes
3. Performance impact is minimal (parameterized queries are often faster)
4. Developers should run `pip install flake8-bandit flake8-sql` for local linting

## Future Recommendations

1. Conduct security audit of other modules for similar vulnerabilities
2. Implement prepared statement caching for frequently used queries
3. Add runtime SQL injection detection and alerting
4. Regular security training for development team on secure coding practices
