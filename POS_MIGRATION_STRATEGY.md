# POS Migration Strategy for AuraConnect

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating existing restaurant clients from Toast, Clover, and Square POS systems to AuraConnect while maintaining their current POS integration.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Setup (Week 1)
1. **POS Authentication**
   - Connect to existing POS using OAuth/API credentials
   - Verify permissions for data access
   - Test connection stability

2. **Data Audit**
   - Count total items, categories, modifiers
   - Identify custom fields and configurations
   - Document current integrations and workflows

### Phase 2: Core Data Import (Week 2)
1. **Menu Migration**
   ```javascript
   // Proposed migration flow
   const migrationSteps = [
     { step: 1, action: "Import Categories", endpoint: "/pos/migration/categories" },
     { step: 2, action: "Import Menu Items", endpoint: "/pos/migration/items" },
     { step: 3, action: "Import Modifiers", endpoint: "/pos/migration/modifiers" },
     { step: 4, action: "Verify Pricing", endpoint: "/pos/migration/verify-prices" }
   ];
   ```

2. **Customer Data**
   - Import customer profiles with consent
   - Migrate loyalty points/rewards
   - Preserve order history references

3. **Historical Data** (Optional)
   - Last 12 months of orders for analytics
   - Sales reports for business continuity
   - Staff performance metrics

### Phase 3: Configuration & Testing (Week 3)
1. **Business Rules**
   - Tax rates and rules
   - Service charges and fees
   - Discount structures
   - Tipping policies

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test order flow (AuraConnect → POS)
   - Verify inventory sync
   - Validate payment processing
   - Check reporting accuracy

### Phase 4: Parallel Running (Week 4)
1. **Soft Launch**
   - Run both systems in parallel
   - Compare daily reports
   - Monitor for discrepancies
   - Train staff on differences

2. **Gradual Transition**
   - Start with online orders
   - Move to in-house orders
   - Transition reporting/analytics
   - Full cutover when stable

## Technical Implementation Needs

### 1. Migration API Endpoints
```python
# backend/modules/pos/routes/migration_routes.py
@router.post("/migration/start/{integration_id}")
async def start_migration(integration_id: int, options: MigrationOptions):
    """Initiate full POS data migration"""

@router.get("/migration/status/{migration_id}")
async def get_migration_status(migration_id: int):
    """Check migration progress"""

@router.post("/migration/preview/{integration_id}")
async def preview_migration(integration_id: int):
    """Preview what will be imported without committing"""

@router.post("/migration/rollback/{migration_id}")
async def rollback_migration(migration_id: int):
    """Rollback a migration if issues found"""
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution
```typescript
interface ConflictResolution {
  strategy: 'keep_existing' | 'overwrite' | 'merge' | 'duplicate';
  fieldMapping: {
    posField: string;
    auraField: string;
    transform?: (value: any) => any;
  }[];
}
```

### 3. Progress Tracking
```javascript
// Real-time migration progress via WebSocket
{
  type: 'migration_progress',
  data: {
    totalItems: 1000,
    processedItems: 450,
    currentStep: 'Importing menu items',
    estimatedTimeRemaining: '5 minutes',
    errors: []
  }
}
```

## POS-Specific Considerations

### Toast
- **Unique Features**: 
  - Kitchen display system integration
  - Advanced modifier routing
  - Multi-location menu management
- **Migration Challenges**:
  - Complex modifier structures
  - Custom dining options (dine-in, takeout, delivery)
  - Integrated payroll data

### Clover
- **Unique Features**:
  - App-based extensions
  - Custom tender types
  - Inventory tracking at variant level
- **Migration Challenges**:
  - App data migration
  - Custom fields on items
  - Device-specific settings

### Square
- **Unique Features**:
  - Catalog variations (size, color)
  - Loyalty program integration
  - Gift card system
- **Migration Challenges**:
  - Complex SKU structures
  - Customer directory privacy
  - Transaction fee reconciliation

## Success Metrics
1. **Data Integrity**
   - 100% menu items migrated
   - Price accuracy within $0.01
   - All active modifiers functional

2. **Operational Continuity**
   - No service interruption
   - < 5 minute staff retraining
   - Same-day reporting available

3. **Financial Accuracy**
   - Daily sales match ±0.1%
   - Tax calculations identical
   - Payment reconciliation complete

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Full POS data export before migration
   - Ability to reverse sync if needed
   - 30-day parallel operation option

2. **Phased Rollout**
   - Start with single location
   - Test with limited menu
   - Gradual feature enablement

3. **Support Plan**
   - Dedicated migration specialist
   - 24/7 support during transition
   - Daily check-ins first week

## Next Steps
1. Complete Toast and Clover adapter implementations
2. Build migration UI in admin panel
3. Create automated testing suite for migrations
4. Develop training materials for each POS type
5. Establish migration specialist team
