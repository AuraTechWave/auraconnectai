# Migration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Multiple Heads Issue**
   - Created `merge_all_heads` migration to consolidate 16 migration branches
   - Created `merge_final_heads` migration to include the new `add_manual_review_tables_v2`
   - Now we have a single head: `merge_final_heads`

2. **Migration Reference Issues**
   - Fixed references to use actual revision IDs instead of file names
   - Updated references like `0015` â†’ `20250727_2200_0015`
   - Fixed references to symbolic revision IDs like `add_pricing_rules_tables`

3. **Enum Type Conflicts**
   - Fixed duplicate `reviewstatus` enum between feedback_and_reviews and manual_review migrations
   - Renamed to `manualreviewstatus` in the manual review migration
   - Added checks to prevent creating duplicate enum types

4. **Missing Migrations**
   - Copied missing migrations from root alembic directory to backend/alembic/versions
   - Ensured all referenced migrations exist in the backend directory

5. **Deprecated GitHub Actions**
   - Updated all workflow files from v3 to v4 actions

6. **Alembic Configuration**
   - Created backend/alembic.ini with proper script_location
   - Updated env.py to support DATABASE_URL environment variable

## Current Status

- Single migration head: `merge_final_heads`
- All migrations are present in backend/alembic/versions
- Enum type conflicts resolved
- GitHub Actions updated

## Remaining Notes

The `20250725_0601_0005_add_external_id_to_orders.py` migration uses type-annotated revision syntax which might cause parsing issues in some scripts, but Alembic itself should handle it correctly.
