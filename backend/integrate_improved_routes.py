=== Integration Guide for Improved Routes ===

To integrate the improved routes with comprehensive error handling and validation,
follow these steps:

1. Update Equipment Routes in main.py:
   Replace line 83:
   - from modules.equipment.routes import router as equipment_router
   + from modules.equipment.routes_improved import router as equipment_router

2. Update KDS Routes in main.py:
   Replace line 33:
   - from modules.kds.routes.kds_routes import router as kds_router
   + from modules.kds.routes.kds_routes_improved import router as kds_router

3. Add Error Handling Middleware (optional):
   After line 195 (register_exception_handlers), add:
   
   from core.error_handling import ErrorHandlingMiddleware
   app.add_middleware(ErrorHandlingMiddleware)

4. Update imports to use improved schemas:
   In any service files that use the schemas, update:
   - from modules.equipment.schemas import ...
   + from modules.equipment.schemas_improved import ...
   
   - from modules.kds.schemas.kds_schemas import ...
   + from modules.kds.schemas.kds_schemas_improved import ...

5. Benefits of the improved routes:
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Input validation with detailed error messages
   - Protection against SQL injection and malicious input
   - Proper permission checks with role-based access control
   - Consistent error response format
   - Better logging and debugging information

6. Testing the improved routes:
   Run the tests created for each module:
   
   pytest backend/modules/equipment/tests/test_equipment_routes.py -v
   pytest backend/modules/kds/tests/test_kds_routes.py -v

7. Error Response Format:
   All errors now follow a consistent format:
   {
       "message": "Human-readable error message",
       "details": {
           "field": "specific_field",
           "error": "Detailed error information"
       }
   }

8. New Permission Requirements:
   Equipment routes now require:
   - EQUIPMENT_VIEW: For read operations
   - EQUIPMENT_CREATE: For creating equipment
   - EQUIPMENT_UPDATE: For updates and maintenance
   - EQUIPMENT_DELETE: For deletion
   
   KDS routes now require:
   - KDS_VIEW: For viewing stations and items
   - KDS_MANAGE: For creating/updating stations
   - KDS_OPERATE: For acknowledging/completing items

9. Environment Variables:
   Ensure these are set for proper error handling:
   - LOG_LEVEL=INFO (or DEBUG for development)
   - ENVIRONMENT=development (or production)

10. Migration Notes:
    - The improved routes are backward compatible
    - Existing API calls will continue to work
    - New validation may reject previously accepted invalid data
    - Update client code to handle new error formats
