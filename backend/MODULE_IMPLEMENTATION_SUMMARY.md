#### Routes (`insights/routes/insights_routes.py`)
- CRUD operations for insights
- Batch operations (acknowledge, dismiss)
- Rating and action tracking
- Thread management
- Notification rule configuration
- Analytics endpoints
- Export functionality

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Insight Generation**: System can generate insights based on data patterns

- **APIKey**: API key management
- **Webhook**: Webhook configuration
- **SettingHistory**: Audit trail

#### Services (`settings/services/settings_service.py`)
- **SettingsService**: Comprehensive settings management
  - Multi-scope support (system, restaurant, location, user)
  - Value encryption for sensitive settings
  - Template application
  - Feature flag evaluation
  - API key validation

#### Routes (`settings/routes/settings_routes.py`)
- Settings CRUD with scope management
- Bulk operations
- Template management
- Feature flag controls
- API key generation and management
- Webhook configuration
- History tracking

### Key Features
1. **Multi-Scope Settings**: System, restaurant, location, and user-level settings

#### Services (`loyalty/services/loyalty_service.py`)
- **LoyaltyService**: Complete loyalty management
  - Points transactions with balance tracking
  - Reward issuance and redemption
  - Campaign management
  - Tier calculations
  - Order integration

#### Routes (`loyalty/routes/loyalty_routes.py`)
- Customer loyalty stats and history
- Points management (add, adjust, transfer)
- Reward template CRUD
- Reward issuance (manual and bulk)
- Redemption with validation
- Campaign management
- Analytics endpoints

### Key Features
1. **Points System**: Earning, spending, transfers, expiration
2. **Reward Types**: Discounts, free items, cashback, tier upgrades
3. **Customer Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum with benefits
4. **Campaigns**: Targeted reward distribution
5. **Triggers**: Order completion, milestones, birthdays, manual
6. **Validation**: Pre-redemption validation
7. **Analytics**: Comprehensive performance tracking

## Integration Points

### Cross-Module Integration
1. **Settings → All Modules**: Configuration values
2. **Insights → Loyalty**: Generate insights on loyalty program performance
3. **Loyalty → Orders**: Process rewards on order completion
4. **All → Notifications**: Unified notification system

### External Integrations
1. **Email**: SMTP integration for notifications
2. **Slack**: Webhook-based alerts
3. **SMS**: Provider integration ready
4. **Webhooks**: Generic webhook support

## Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**: Sensitive settings encrypted at rest
2. **API Keys**: Hashed storage with scope-based permissions
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built into notification system
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history for compliance
5. **Permission Checks**: Role-based access control

## Testing Requirements

Each module requires comprehensive testing:

### Unit Tests
- Model validation
- Service logic
- Helper functions

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Cross-module interactions

### Performance Tests
- Bulk operations
- Analytics calculations
- Search and filtering

## Migration Notes

### Database Migrations Required
1. **Insights Module**: New tables for insights, ratings, threads
2. **Settings Module**: Settings storage with encryption support
3. **Loyalty Module**: Points ledger, rewards, campaigns

### Data Migration
- Existing POS sync settings can be migrated to new settings system
- Customer points data may need migration from legacy system

## Future Enhancements
