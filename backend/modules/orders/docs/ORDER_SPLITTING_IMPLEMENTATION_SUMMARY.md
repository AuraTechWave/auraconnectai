# Order Splitting Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive order splitting functionality for the AuraConnect restaurant management platform. This feature enables restaurants to split customer orders into multiple tickets or deliveries, supporting separate preparation and payment handling.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Models (order_models.py)

Added two new models to support order splitting:

- **OrderSplit**: Tracks the relationship between parent and split orders
  - Links parent_order_id to split_order_id
  - Stores split type (ticket, delivery, payment)
  - Tracks who performed the split and why
  - Includes metadata for split-specific information

- **SplitPayment**: Manages payment allocation for split orders
  - Tracks payment amounts for each split
  - Monitors payment status and methods
  - Links payments to specific customers

### 2. Schemas (order_split_schemas.py)

Created comprehensive Pydantic schemas for:

- **SplitType**: Enum for ticket, delivery, and payment splits
- **OrderSplitRequest**: Validates split requests with items and metadata
- **PaymentSplitRequest**: Handles payment distribution requests
- **SplitValidationResponse**: Returns validation results before splitting
- **OrderSplitResponse**: Provides split operation results
- **SplitOrderSummary**: Comprehensive view of all splits for an order
- **MergeSplitRequest**: Handles merging split orders back together

### 3. Service Layer (order_split_service.py)

Implemented OrderSplitService with key methods:

- **validate_split_request()**: Pre-validates splits without making changes
- **split_order()**: Main method that routes to specific split types
- **_split_by_ticket()**: Handles kitchen ticket splitting
- **_split_by_delivery()**: Manages delivery splits
- **_split_by_payment()**: Creates payment splits
- **split_order_for_payment()**: Dedicated payment splitting method
- **get_split_summary()**: Returns comprehensive split information
- **update_split_payment()**: Updates payment status
- **merge_split_orders()**: Combines splits back together
- **get_split_tracking()**: Provides detailed tracking information
- **update_split_status()**: Manages split order status changes

### 4. API Routes (order_split_routes.py)

Created RESTful endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/split/validate` - Validate split feasibility
- `POST /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/split` - Create order split
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/splits` - Get split summary
- `POST /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/split/payment` - Split payment
- `PUT /api/v1/orders/splits/payment/{payment_id}` - Update payment status
- `POST /api/v1/orders/splits/merge` - Merge split orders
- `GET /api/v1/orders/splits/by-table/{table_no}` - Get table splits
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/splits/tracking` - Get tracking info
- `PUT /api/v1/orders/splits/{split_order_id}/status` - Update split status

### 5. Testing

Comprehensive test coverage with:

- **test_order_split_service.py**: Unit tests for service methods
  - Validation tests
  - Split operation tests
  - Payment handling tests
  - Tracking and status tests
  - Merge operation tests

- **test_order_split_routes.py**: API endpoint tests
  - Request/response validation
  - Authentication tests
  - Error handling tests
  - Integration scenarios

### 6. Database Migration

Created Alembic migration (add_order_splitting_tables.py):
- Adds order_splits table with proper indexes
- Adds split_payments table with constraints
- Includes check constraints for enums
- Provides clean rollback functionality

### 7. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation includes:
- **ORDER_SPLITTING_GUIDE.md**: Complete user guide
  - API endpoint documentation
  - Use case examples
  - Best practices
  - Error handling guide
  - Integration notes

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Split Types

- **Ticket Split**: Route items to different kitchen stations
- **Delivery Split**: Separate items for different deliveries
- **Payment Split**: Divide payment among multiple parties

### 2. Core Functionality

- **Validation**: Pre-check splits before execution
- **Flexible Splitting**: Support partial item quantities
- **Payment Tracking**: Monitor payment collection
- **Status Management**: Independent status for each split
- **Merge Capability**: Combine splits back together
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Real-time split monitoring

### 3. Integration Points

- **Webhook Support**: Notifications for split events
- **POS Integration**: Individual split synchronization
- **KDS Integration**: Automatic routing to kitchen stations
- **Order Tracking**: Customer visibility for splits

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control via auth decorators
- Validation of all inputs
- Transaction safety with rollback support
- Audit trail in metadata

## Performance Optimizations

- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Efficient query patterns with joinedload
- Bulk operations where applicable
- Minimal database round trips

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Smart Splitting**: AI-based split suggestions
2. **Mobile Support**: Customer-initiated splits
3. **Analytics**: Split pattern analysis
4. **Automation**: Rule-based automatic splitting
5. **Enhanced KDS**: Visual split management

## Testing the Implementation

Run tests:
```bash
# Run service tests
pytest backend/modules/orders/tests/test_order_split_service.py -v

# Run route tests
pytest backend/modules/orders/tests/test_order_split_routes.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest backend/modules/orders/tests/test_order_split*.py --cov=backend/modules/orders
```

Apply migration:
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```
