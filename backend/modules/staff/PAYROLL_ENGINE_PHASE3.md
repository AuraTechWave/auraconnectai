## Usage Examples

### Basic Payroll Processing

```python
from enhanced_payroll_service import EnhancedPayrollService
from datetime import date

# Initialize service
payroll_service = EnhancedPayrollService(db_session)

# Process payroll for a single staff member
payroll_result = await payroll_service.process_payroll_for_staff(
    staff_id=1,
    pay_period_start=date(2024, 1, 15),
    pay_period_end=date(2024, 1, 29),
    tenant_id=123
)

print(f"Gross Pay: ${payroll_result.gross_pay}")
print(f"Net Pay: ${payroll_result.net_pay}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process payroll for multiple staff members
staff_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
results = await payroll_service.process_payroll_batch(
    staff_ids=staff_ids,
    pay_period_start=date(2024, 1, 15),
    pay_period_end=date(2024, 1, 29),
    tenant_id=123
)

for result in results:
    print(f"Staff {result.staff_id}: ${result.net_pay}")
```

### Payroll Summary

```python
# Get payroll summary for a period
summary = await payroll_service.get_payroll_summary(
    pay_period_start=date(2024, 1, 15),
    pay_period_end=date(2024, 1, 29),
    tenant_id=123
)

print(f"Total Employees: {summary['total_employees']}")
print(f"Total Gross Pay: ${summary['total_gross_pay']}")
print(f"Total Tax Deductions: ${summary['total_tax_deductions']}")
```

## Integration Points

### Dependencies (AUR-275, AUR-276)

- **AUR-275**: Payroll schemas and models ✓
- **AUR-276**: Tax services foundation ✓
- **Staff Management**: Staff member and role data
- **Attendance System**: Time tracking and hours data

### Tax Services Integration

The engine integrates with the tax services implemented in AUR-276:

```python
# Tax calculation request
tax_request = PayrollTaxServiceRequest(
    employee_id=staff_id,
    gross_amount=gross_pay,
    pay_period_start=pay_period_start,
    pay_period_end=pay_period_end,
    location=location,
    tenant_id=tenant_id
)

# Calculate taxes
tax_response = await self.tax_service.calculate_and_save_taxes(tax_request)
```

### EmployeePayment Records

The engine creates comprehensive payment records:

```python
payment = EmployeePayment(
    employee_id=staff_id,
    pay_period_start=pay_period_start,
    pay_period_end=pay_period_end,
    gross_amount=gross_pay,
    net_amount=net_pay,
    regular_hours=regular_hours,
    overtime_hours=overtime_hours,
    # Detailed earnings breakdown
    regular_pay=regular_pay,
    overtime_pay=overtime_pay,
    bonus_pay=bonus,
    # Tax deductions
    federal_tax_amount=federal_tax,
    state_tax_amount=state_tax,
    # Benefit deductions
    health_insurance_amount=health_insurance,
    retirement_amount=retirement,
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    processed_at=datetime.utcnow()
)
```
