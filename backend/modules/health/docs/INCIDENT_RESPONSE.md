# Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the incident response procedures for the AuraConnect AI production system. It covers monitoring, alerting, escalation, and resolution procedures.

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Access
- **URL**: `https://api.auraconnect.ai/api/v1/health/dashboard`
- **Authentication**: Requires system admin role
- **Refresh Rate**: Real-time with 5-second polling

### Key Metrics
1. **System Health**: Overall system status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
2. **Component Status**: Individual component health (database, Redis, API, workers)
3. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
4. **Active Alerts**: Current unresolved system alerts
5. **Error Summary**: Recent errors and affected endpoints

## Alert Severity Levels

### Critical (Response Time: Immediate)
- System completely down
- Database connection lost
- Error rate > 10% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 5 seconds sustained
- Security breach detected

### Warning (Response Time: 15 minutes)
- Component degraded performance
- Error rate > 5% for 10 minutes
- Response time > 2 seconds sustained
- Memory usage > 85%
- Disk usage > 90%

### Info (Response Time: 1 hour)
- Elevated error rates (> 2%)
- Performance degradation trends
- Scheduled maintenance reminders
- Non-critical service interruptions

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection
- Automated monitoring via health check endpoints
- Alert notifications (email, SMS, Slack)
- User reports
- Performance degradation alerts

### 2. Triage
1. Check monitoring dashboard
2. Identify affected components
3. Assess severity and impact
4. Assign incident commander

### 3. Initial Response

#### For Critical Incidents:
```bash
# 1. Check overall health
curl https://api.auraconnect.ai/api/v1/health

# 2. Check detailed health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.auraconnect.ai/api/v1/health/detailed

# 3. View recent errors
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.auraconnect.ai/api/v1/health/errors?hours=1

# 4. Check system metrics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.auraconnect.ai/api/v1/health/metrics
```

#### Quick Checks:
1. **Database**: Check connection pool and query performance
2. **Redis**: Verify connectivity and memory usage
3. **API**: Monitor response times and error rates
4. **Workers**: Check background job queues

### 4. Diagnosis

#### Common Issues and Solutions:

**High Error Rate**
1. Check error logs: `/api/v1/health/errors`
2. Identify error patterns
3. Check recent deployments
4. Review database query performance

**Slow Response Times**
1. Check performance metrics: `/api/v1/health/performance`
2. Identify slow endpoints
3. Check database query times
4. Review cache hit rates

**Database Issues**
1. Check connection pool status
2. Review slow query log
3. Check disk space
4. Verify backup status

**Memory Issues**
1. Check system metrics
2. Identify memory leaks
3. Review cache usage
4. Check worker memory consumption

### 5. Resolution

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Scale Resources**: Add more servers/workers if needed
2. **Clear Cache**: Reset Redis cache if corrupted
3. **Restart Services**: Restart affected components
4. **Rollback**: Revert recent deployments if necessary

#### Long-term Actions:
1. **Optimize Queries**: Fix slow database queries
2. **Code Fixes**: Deploy patches for identified bugs
3. **Infrastructure**: Upgrade resources if needed
4. **Monitoring**: Add additional checks for problem areas

### 6. Communication

#### Internal Communication:
- Slack channel: #incidents
- Email: incidents@auraconnect.ai
- Phone tree for critical incidents

#### Customer Communication:
- Status page updates
- Email notifications for affected customers
- Social media updates for widespread issues

### 7. Post-Incident

#### Within 24 hours:
1. Update incident log
2. Resolve alerts in monitoring system
3. Document temporary fixes
4. Schedule permanent fixes

#### Within 48 hours:
1. Conduct post-mortem meeting
2. Create incident report
3. Update runbooks
4. Implement preventive measures
