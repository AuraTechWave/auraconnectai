# Refund Processing Implementation Summary

## Linear Ticket: AUR-333
**Task:** Refund processing for customer orders

## Implementation Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive refund processing system for AuraConnect with the following components:

### 1. Database Models (`modules/payments/models/refund_models.py`)

- **RefundReason Enum**: 16 standard refund reason codes
- **RefundCategory Enum**: 5 categories (order_issue, quality_issue, service_issue, payment_issue, other)
- **RefundApprovalStatus Enum**: Workflow states (pending_approval, approved, rejected, auto_approved)
- **RefundPolicy Model**: Configurable per-restaurant refund policies
- **RefundRequest Model**: Tracks refund requests with full workflow support
- **RefundAuditLog Model**: Complete audit trail for compliance

### 2. Business Logic (`modules/payments/services/refund_service.py`)

- **RefundService Class**: Handles all refund operations
  - Create refund requests with validation
  - Auto-approval based on configurable thresholds
  - Approval/rejection workflow
  - Integration with payment service for processing
  - Audit logging for all actions
  - Statistics and reporting

Key features:
- Validates refund amount against original payment
- Checks refund time window (configurable per policy)
- Automatic approval for amounts under threshold
- Complete audit trail with actor tracking

### 3. API Endpoints (`modules/payments/api/refund_endpoints.py`)

- `POST /refunds/request` - Create refund request
- `GET /refunds/requests` - List requests with filtering
- `GET /refunds/requests/{id}` - Get request details
- `POST /refunds/requests/{id}/approve` - Approve request
- `POST /refunds/requests/{id}/reject` - Reject request
- `POST /refunds/requests/{id}/process` - Process refund
- `GET /refunds/statistics` - Get refund analytics
- `GET /refunds/reasons` - Get reason codes and categories
- `POST /refunds/policies` - Manage refund policies

### 4. Database Migration (`alembic/versions/20250804_1800_add_refund_processing_tables.py`)

Created tables:
- `refund_policies` - Restaurant-specific refund policies
- `refund_requests` - Refund request tracking
- `refund_audit_logs` - Audit trail
- Enhanced `refunds` table with 14 additional columns

### 5. Tests (`modules/payments/tests/test_refund_service.py`)

- Enum completeness tests
- Category mapping tests
- Validation logic tests
- Workflow state transition tests

### 6. Documentation (`modules/payments/docs/REFUND_API.md`)

- Complete API documentation
- Request/response examples
- Permission requirements
- Integration notes

## Technical Decisions

1. **Enum-based Reason Codes**: Using Python enums for type safety and consistency
2. **Separate Request and Refund Models**: Allows tracking requests before processing
3. **Policy-based Configuration**: Each restaurant can have custom refund rules
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking for compliance and dispute resolution
5. **Auto-approval Logic**: Reduces manual work for small refunds

## Integration Points

- **Payment Service**: For processing actual refunds
- **Order Module**: For validating order details
- **Authentication**: Role-based permissions for approval/processing
- **Notifications**: Hooks for customer/staff notifications (to be implemented)

## Next Steps

1. **Notifications**: Implement email/SMS notifications for refund status updates
2. **Receipts**: Generate refund receipts for customers
3. **Reporting**: Add comprehensive refund analytics dashboard
4. **Webhooks**: Add webhook support for external integrations
5. **Testing**: Add integration tests with payment gateways

## Files Modified/Created

- Created:
  - `backend/modules/payments/models/refund_models.py`
  - `backend/modules/payments/services/refund_service.py`
  - `backend/modules/payments/api/refund_endpoints.py`
  - `backend/alembic/versions/20250804_1800_add_refund_processing_tables.py`
  - `backend/modules/payments/tests/test_refund_service.py`
  - `backend/modules/payments/docs/REFUND_API.md`

- Modified:
  - `backend/modules/payments/models/__init__.py` - Added refund model exports
  - `backend/modules/payments/services/__init__.py` - Added refund service exports
  - `backend/modules/payments/api/__init__.py` - Included refund router
  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added payment router to app
  - `backend/modules/payments/models/payment_models.py` - Fixed metadata field name
  - `backend/modules/payments/models/split_bill_models.py` - Fixed metadata field name

## Notes

- The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase
- All monetary amounts use Decimal for precision
- Timezone-aware datetime handling throughout
- Proper error handling and validation
- Permission-based access control

The refund processing system is now ready for use and can handle various refund scenarios with proper approval workflows and audit trails.
