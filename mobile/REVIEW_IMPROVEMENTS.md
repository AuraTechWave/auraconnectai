# Mobile App Review Improvements

This document summarizes all improvements made in response to the code review for AUR-309.

## 1. Centralized Error Handling

### Implementation
- Created `services/error.service.ts` with centralized error handling
- Removed direct `showToast()` calls from API interceptors
- Added structured error types and handler registration system
- API errors now flow through `errorService.handleApiError()`

### Benefits
- Consistent error handling across the app
- Ability to register custom error handlers
- Better error categorization and recovery options

## 2. Configuration Management

### Implementation
- Created `constants/config.ts` with all configuration constants
- Extracted magic values including:
  - API configuration (timeouts, retry counts)
  - Authentication settings (token keys, storage services)
  - Offline queue configuration
  - Cache settings
  - Security flags

### Usage
```typescript
import { API_CONFIG, AUTH_CONFIG, OFFLINE_CONFIG } from '@constants/config';
```

## 3. Enhanced Offline Queue

### Improvements
- Added queue size limit (`MAX_QUEUE_SIZE: 100`)
- Implemented optional encryption for queued requests
- Added batch processing for sync operations
- Better retry management with configurable limits

### Security
- Sensitive data in offline queue is encrypted using device-specific keys
- Encryption service uses CryptoJS with AES encryption

## 4. Secure Logging

### Implementation
- Created `utils/logger.ts` with security-aware logging
- Automatic sanitization of sensitive data:
  - Passwords, tokens, and API keys are redacted
  - Long strings that look like tokens are masked
  - Sensitive headers are sanitized
- Network request/response logging without exposing secrets

### Features
- Log levels: debug, info, warn, error
- Context-aware logging with automatic sanitization
- Special methods for network logging
- Configurable via `DEV_CONFIG` and `SECURITY_CONFIG`

## 5. Performance Optimizations

### Lottie Animation Code Splitting
- Lazy loading of Lottie animations
- Fallback to ActivityIndicator while loading
- Reduces initial bundle size

## 6. Comprehensive Testing

### Test Coverage Added
1. **API Client Token Refresh** (`__tests__/services/api.client.test.ts`)
   - Token refresh on 401 response
   - Concurrent request handling during refresh
   - Refresh failure scenarios
   - Token storage and retrieval

2. **Offline Queue Processing** (`__tests__/services/offline.service.test.ts`)
   - Queue size enforcement
   - Encryption/decryption of sensitive data
   - Batch processing
   - Network state monitoring
   - Retry logic

3. **Navigation Auth Flow** (`__tests__/navigation/auth.flow.test.tsx`)
   - Initial load states
   - Login/logout transitions
   - Token validation flows
   - Refresh token scenarios

## 7. Dependencies Added

- `crypto-js`: For encryption functionality
- `axios-mock-adapter`: For API testing
- `@testing-library/react-native`: For component testing
- `@types/crypto-js`: TypeScript definitions

## 8. Security Enhancements

### Token Storage
- All token storage uses configurable keys from config
- Consistent use of Keychain for secure storage

### Request Security
- No sensitive data logged in production
- Automatic token masking in logs
- Encrypted offline queue for sensitive requests

### Error Handling
- No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- Structured error responses without internal details

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Code
1. Replace direct `showToast()` calls with error service
2. Update hardcoded strings to use config constants
3. Use logger instead of console.log for debugging

### Configuration
- Update `.env` files with new configuration options
- Enable/disable features via `FEATURE_FLAGS`
- Configure security settings in `SECURITY_CONFIG`
