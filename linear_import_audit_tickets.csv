"Fix Database Session Management in Background Workers","Background workers (notification_worker.py, data_retention_worker.py) incorrectly use `async with get_db()` which causes database session cleanup failures and potential connection leaks.

**Affected Files:**
- backend/workers/notification_worker.py

**Issue:** Using async context manager with synchronous get_db() function

**Solution:** Use SessionLocal() directly with try/finally blocks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Replace async context managers with proper synchronous session handling
- Add unit tests for worker database operations
- Verify no connection leaks in monitoring

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Causes connection pool exhaustion","Urgent","Bug, Critical, Backend, Audit","4","Backlog",""
