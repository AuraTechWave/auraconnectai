# AUR-444: Remove Hardcoded Production Credentials

## Summary of Changes

This PR addresses critical security vulnerabilities by removing hardcoded credentials and implementing proper secret management.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Secure Secret Management** (`backend/core/secrets.py`)
- Created a fail-safe secret retrieval system
- Validates that required secrets are set in environment variables
- Prevents dangerous defaults from reaching production
- Fails fast in production if secrets are missing

### 2. **Updated Authentication** (`backend/core/auth.py`)
- Removed hardcoded JWT secret key fallback
- Mock users now only available in development environment
- JWT 'sub' field properly handled as string per JWT standard
- Added environment detection for test scenarios

### 3. **Enhanced Configuration** (`backend/core/config.py`, `backend/core/config_validation.py`)
- Integrated secure secret management
- Database URL and JWT secret now required from environment
- Removed hardcoded defaults for sensitive values
- Added proper validation for production environments

### 4. **Startup Validation** (`backend/core/startup_validation.py`, `backend/app/startup.py`)
- Added comprehensive security validation at application startup
- Validates all required secrets before starting
- Fails fast in production if configuration is insecure
- Provides clear error messages for missing configurations

### 5. **Documentation** (`docs/deployment/SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md`)
- Comprehensive guide for managing secrets in different environments
- Examples for various deployment scenarios (Docker, Kubernetes, systemd)
- Integration guides for secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Troubleshooting section for common issues

### 6. **Updated Example Configuration** (`backend/.env.example`)
- Clear instructions for generating secure secrets
- Warnings about production requirements
- Complete list of all configurable secrets

## Security Improvements

1. **No more hardcoded credentials** - All secrets must come from environment variables
2. **Fail-safe approach** - Application won't start with missing or insecure secrets in production
3. **Development/Production separation** - Mock users only available in development
4. **Clear documentation** - Deployment teams know exactly what secrets are required

## Testing

- Authentication functionality tested and working
- Token creation and verification confirmed
- Development environment continues to work with mock users
- Production safeguards in place

## Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production, ensure:
1. All required environment variables are set
2. Secrets are generated using cryptographically secure methods
3. No development defaults are used
4. Secret management solution is in place

## Breaking Changes

- Production deployments MUST set JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable
- Production deployments MUST set SESSION_SECRET environment variable
- Mock users no longer available in production environment
