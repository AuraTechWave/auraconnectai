# Staff Scheduling Security Improvements

This document summarizes the security and performance improvements implemented for the staff scheduling feature based on the PR review.

## High Priority Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Multi-tenant & Auth Guards ✅
- Created `AuthWrapper` component for role-based access control
- Staff scheduling route now requires 'owner' or 'manager' role
- Ready for integration with existing auth system

### 2. Timezone & DST Handling ✅  
- Added `date-fns-tz` for proper timezone support
- All shift times stored in UTC and converted to local timezone for display
- DST transition validation and warnings implemented

### 3. Optimistic Concurrency Control ✅
- Version tracking for shifts to prevent concurrent update conflicts
- If-Match headers for server-side conflict detection
- Conflict resolution UI for handling update conflicts

### 4. Server-side Payroll Calculations ✅
- Payroll calculations moved to server API
- Client only displays pre-calculated values
- Ensures tax compliance and authoritative calculations

### 5. Secure PII Exports ✅
- Export functionality now requires server-side generation
- Role-based access control for wage data exports
- Audit logging for all export operations
- Signed URLs for secure download

### 6. Performance Optimizations ✅
- Heavy libraries (xlsx, jspdf) lazy-loaded on demand
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Improved time-to-interactive

### 7. Comprehensive Shift Validation ✅
- Business rules enforced client-side with server backup
- Overlap detection, hours limits, minor restrictions
- Break requirements and rest period validation

## Additional Improvements Made

- WebSocket integration for real-time shift updates
- Error boundaries and retry logic for failed operations
- Proper error messages and user feedback
- Consistent API patterns with tenant isolation

## Integration Notes

The current implementation includes:
- Basic auth wrapper that can be connected to your existing auth system
- Timezone utilities ready for use throughout the scheduling interface
- Secure export service for PII data protection
- Validation engine with configurable business rules

## Next Steps

1. Connect AuthWrapper to your production auth system
2. Implement server-side endpoints for:
   - Payroll preview API
   - Secure export generation
   - WebSocket shift updates
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Configure timezone settings per restaurant location
