# Migration Guide: Beta to v1.0.0

This guide helps you migrate from the beta API to v1.0.0.

## Overview

Version 1.0.0 introduces several improvements and standardizations to the API. Most changes are backward compatible, but some breaking changes were necessary for consistency.

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Standardized DateTime Format
All datetime fields now use ISO 8601 format with timezone information.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "created_at": "2025-08-08 10:30:00"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "created_at": "2025-08-08T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Unified Pagination
All list endpoints now use consistent pagination parameters.

**Before:**
```
GET /api/v1/orders?page=1&limit=20
```

**After:**
```
GET /api/v1/orders?page=1&page_size=20
```

### 3. Error Response Format
Standardized error responses across all endpoints.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "error": "Not found"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "detail": "Order not found",
  "status": 404,
  "type": "not_found",
  "instance": "/api/v1/orders/123"
}
```
