# Ai Agents Module Architecture

## Overview
Central logic for agentic automation across the platform.

## System Flow
- Agent initialized based on context (e.g., reservation, payroll)
- Inputs gathered from DB + user
- Prompt generated dynamically
- LLM response interpreted
- Action triggered (DB update, notification, suggestion)

## Key Components
- Agent Core Engine
- LangChain/CrewAI Framework
- Prompt Factory
- Tool Integration

## Developer Notes
Each component should follow service-layer design with unit test coverage.
