# Offline Sync Module Architecture

## Overview
Allows local order placement and queueing when internet is unavailable.

## System Flow
- Offline mode triggers
- Orders cached locally
- Background sync service watches status
- On reconnect: data pushed and conflicts resolved
- DB updated

## Key Components
- Local Storage Handler
- Sync Watcher
- Conflict Resolver
- Recovery Agent

## Developer Notes
Each component should follow service-layer design with unit test coverage.
