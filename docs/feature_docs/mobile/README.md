## Key Components

### NotificationService
Central service managing all push notification functionality including FCM token management, notification display, and preference handling.

### OfflineManager
Handles offline data storage, queue management, and synchronization when connectivity is restored.

### SyncService
Manages real-time data synchronization between mobile app and backend services.

## Getting Started

1. **Push Notifications Setup**: See [push-notifications.md](./push-notifications.md)
2. **Offline Configuration**: See [Offline Sync Documentation](../offline_sync/README.md)
3. **Testing Guide**: Testing Guide (Coming Soon)

## Performance Considerations

- Notification history is limited to 100 items
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Batch synchronization for offline data
- Exponential backoff for failed operations

## Security

- FCM tokens are always encrypted
- Secure storage for notification preferences
- Authentication required for all API calls
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
