## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Start with the [System Architecture](architecture/README.md) to understand the overall design
2. Set up your development environment following the main [README](../README.md)
3. Explore module-specific documentation based on your area of work

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Review the Production Deployment Guide (see source code)
2. Check the [CI/CD Setup](dev/CI_CD_SETUP.md) for automation
3. Understand the [System Architecture](architecture/README.md) for infrastructure planning

### For Product Managers
1. Explore feature-specific documentation in the [feature_docs](feature_docs/) directory
2. Review the [Global Architecture Overview](dev/architecture/global_architecture_overview.md)
3. Check module architectures for capability understanding

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Monolith**: Self-contained modules with clear boundaries
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic encapsulated in services
- **API-First**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
- **Event-Driven**: Webhook system for integrations

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
- **Cache**: Redis 7+
- **Container**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens

## üîç Finding Information

### By Feature
- Browse the [feature_docs](feature_docs/) directory for feature-specific documentation
- Each feature has a README and architecture document

### By Module
- Check the [dev/architecture](dev/architecture/) directory for module-specific architectures
- Core modules: Orders, Staff, Payroll, Tax, POS

### By Topic
- **Security**: See [System Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#security-architecture)
- **Performance**: See [System Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#performance-architecture)
- **Deployment**: See Production Deployment Guide (see source code)

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place feature documentation in `feature_docs/[feature_name]/`
2. Add architecture documents in `dev/architecture/`
3. Update this README with links to new documentation
4. Follow the existing documentation structure and style

## üìû Support

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs and request features
- **API Documentation**: Available at `/docs` when running the application
- **Architecture Questions**: Refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/README.md)
