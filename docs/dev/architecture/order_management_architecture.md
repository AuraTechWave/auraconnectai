# AuraConnect ‚Äì Order Management (FOH + BOH)

## 1. üßæ Overview & Goals

This module facilitates seamless order flow from Front of House (FOH) to Back of House (BOH). It ensures real-time updates, status tracking, and task routing between customers, servers, kitchen staff, and delivery.

**Goals:**

- Enable order capture across dine-in, takeout, delivery
- Sync FOH terminals with kitchen displays
- Track order lifecycle: pending ‚Üí in kitchen ‚Üí ready ‚Üí served
- Route tasks based on roles and stations (e.g. grill, fry, bar)

---

## 2. üìã Features

- Multi-source order intake (POS, kiosk, QR, mobile)
- Status pipeline with timestamps
- Item routing to respective kitchen stations
- Real-time updates for FOH staff
- Delayed prep alerts and reminders

---

## 3. üß± Architecture Overview

**Core Services:**

- `OrderService` ‚Äì Captures and tracks orders
- `RoutingEngine` ‚Äì Distributes order items to stations
- `KitchenDisplayService` ‚Äì Push updates to BOH UI
- `NotificationService` ‚Äì Delays, readiness pings
- `AuditLogger` ‚Äì For compliance & replay

```

## 4. üîÑ Workflow Flowcharts

### Order Lifecycle:

1. Order received (QR/app/POS)
2. Items parsed and assigned to stations
3. BOH sees item queue on their KDS (Kitchen Display System)
4. Staff marks item as ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúReady‚Äù
5. FOH notified ‚Üí Delivered ‚Üí Marked complete

---

## 5. üì° API Endpoints (REST)

### Order APIs

- `POST /orders` ‚Äì create order
- `GET /orders` ‚Äì list all
- `GET /orders/:id` ‚Äì fetch order
- `PUT /orders/:id/status` ‚Äì update status

### Routing & Status

- `POST /route` ‚Äì reroute item to station
- `GET /stations/:id/queue` ‚Äì current kitchen queue

---

## 6. üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

### Table: `orders`

\| id | table\_no | customer\_id | status | created\_at |

### Table: `order_items`

\| id | order\_id | item\_name | station | status | started\_at | completed\_at |

### Table: `stations`

\| id | name | staff\_id |

---

## 7. üõ†Ô∏è Code Stub

```ts
// order.service.ts
app.post("/orders", authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const order = await db.insert("orders", req.body);
  routeItemsToStations(order);
  res.status(201).json(order);
});
```

---

## 8. üìò Developer Notes

- WebSockets recommended for real-time updates to BOH and FOH
- RoutingEngine logic must support custom rules (e.g. vegetarian-only stations)
- Audit logs help with tracing issues and delays
- Design for performance under kitchen load (use Redis queues or batching)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This module connects the guest-facing experience with BOH execution. A high-performing order management system is critical to fast service, reduced errors, and streamlined kitchen operations.
