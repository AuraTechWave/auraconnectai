## 7. üõ†Ô∏è Initial Code Stub

```ts
// loyalty.service.ts
app.post("/loyalty/redeem", authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const { customerId, points } = req.body;
  const success = await loyaltyEngine.redeem(customerId, points);
  res.status(success ? 200 : 400).json({ success });
});
```

---

## 8. üìò Developer Notes

- Use `jsonb` for storing flexible customer preferences
- Tier logic should be configurable (admin panel rules)
- Referral tracking must prevent abuse (limit redeems, cooldowns)
- Coupons should support various types: % off, \$ off, free item
