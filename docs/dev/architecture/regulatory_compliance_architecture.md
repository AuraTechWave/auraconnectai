# AuraConnect – Regulatory & Compliance Add-on

## 1. 🏛️ Overview & Goals
This module helps restaurants adhere to local, regional, and international compliance standards in food safety, labor laws, digital data regulations (like GDPR), taxation, and audit trails.

**Goals:**
- Provide regulatory templates per country/state
- Enable automated logging of sensitive actions
- Ensure auditability of tax, staff, and order data
- Support food safety and health code tracking
- Offer exportable compliance reports

---

## 2. ✅ Key Compliance Areas
- **Taxation**: GST, VAT, TIN, electronic invoicing
- **Labor**: Working hours, overtime, age restrictions
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA, user data management
- **Food Safety**: Expiry tracking, allergen tagging
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of sensitive actions

---

## 3. 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Core Services:**
- `ComplianceEngine` – Orchestrates validation & policies
- `AuditLogger` – Immutable record keeper
- `PolicyStore` – Configurable rules per region
- `ExportService` – CSV/PDF log export
- `NotificationService` – Reminders for non-compliance

```

## 4. 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Audit Logging Flow:
1. A manager modifies a tax rule
2. ComplianceEngine logs the action
3. AuditLogger stores immutable log with metadata

### Policy Alert Flow:
1. Shift exceeds legal max duration
2. NotificationService alerts admin

### Data Request Flow:
1. Customer requests data deletion (GDPR)
2. System queues and completes anonymization

---

## 5. 📡 API Endpoints

### Policy Management
- `GET /compliance/policies/:region`
- `POST /compliance/policies` – add custom rule

### Audit Logs
- `GET /compliance/auditlogs` – query by user/module/date

### Regulatory Exports
- `GET /compliance/export/audit`
- `GET /compliance/export/tax`
- `GET /compliance/export/labor`

---

## 6. 🗃️ Database Schema

### Table: `audit_logs`
| id | action | module | user_id | meta (jsonb) | timestamp |

### Table: `compliance_policies`
| id | region | type | rule_json | created_at |

---

## 7. 🛠️ Code Stub
```ts
// auditLogger.ts
function logAudit(action, module, userId, meta) {
  db.insert("audit_logs", { action, module, user_id: userId, meta, timestamp: new Date() });
}
```

---

## 8. 📘 Developer Notes
- Use append-only design for `audit_logs`
- Support versioned policies for future-proofing
- Include legal text downloads for tax/HR compliance
- Consider external auditor role with read-only access

---

## ✅ Summary
This add-on ensures AuraConnect deployments can meet regulatory standards and pass audits confidently. It promotes responsible data use, staff safety, and tax/legal transparency.

✔️ **All modules completed!** AuraConnect is now fully architected.
