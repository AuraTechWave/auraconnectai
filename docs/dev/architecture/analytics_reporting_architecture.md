## 6. üóÉÔ∏è Data Schema (Warehouse Schema Design)

Tables are denormalized for fast querying:

### Table: `sales_agg`

\| date | total\_sales | avg\_ticket | payment\_types (jsonb) |

### Table: `staff_metrics`

\| date | staff\_id | hours | orders\_handled | tips |

### Table: `inventory_agg`

\| date | item\_id | used\_qty | waste | cost |

---

## 7. üõ†Ô∏è Code Stub

```ts
// analytics.service.ts
app.get("/analytics/sales", authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const { from, to } = req.query;
  const data = await db.query("SELECT * FROM sales_agg WHERE date BETWEEN $1 AND $2", [from, to]);
  res.json(data);
});
```

---

## 8. üìò Developer Notes

- Use materialized views or pre-computed tables for performance
- PDF/CSV exports should support branded templates
- Include access control to restrict financial data visibility
- Enable embeddable widgets (e.g. Net Sales Today)

---
